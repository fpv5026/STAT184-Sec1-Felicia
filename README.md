# Introduction 
In this activity, I analyzed the Berkley Dataset. The history behind this dataset is stated by the creater as the following:

> The year is 1973. UC Berkeley has been sued for sex-based admissions discrimination. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that women are discriminated against in admissions policies. The court has provided admissions data to you and tasked you with answering the question â€” if a student applies to the school, will their gender play a significant role in their chance of admission?

**Our goal in this project was to determine if gender plays a significant role in a students chance of admission at UC Berkeley in 1973.** Therefore, the purpose of this repository is to assist in looking at various relationships amongst the variables in this datatset-- ultimately answer this research question.

In order to coprehensively answer this question, we went through **seven specfic tasks**: Data inventory, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Admission Rates by Gender, Applications Received Grouped by Gender and Major, Admission Rates Grouped by Gender and Major, Gender Difference in Admission Rates by Major. 

In the Berkely dataset, individual student are cases, and their attributes are Year, Major, Gender, and Admission.
